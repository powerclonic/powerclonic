## About Me

Hey! I'm Matheus, but you can call me Power! I've been in the game since I was 16. 

My first touch with programming was in 2018 when I was just 13 years old, but it was in 2021 when I got deep into web development with PHP + Laravel and Vue.js.

I also handle databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. Lately, I've been diving into Python for AWS Lambda and Step Functions. 

I pick up new skills fast, love team work, and embrace agile methods. Let's connect!
